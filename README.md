#Introduction to Database Course Projects
Welcome to the Introduction to Database Course Projects folder! This repository contains SQL scripts and examples completed by me as part of the Introduction to Database course at the University of Lodz. The provided SQL files demonstrate various concepts and techniques used in database management, including database schema setup, data insertion, querying, and manipulation.

#Contents:
Database Setup:

*The SQL scripts define the database schema by creating tables for customers, rooms, services, and their relationships. Primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints are defined to ensure data integrity. Initial data is inserted into the tables to populate them with records.
Database Queries:

*SQL queries are provided to retrieve and manipulate data from the database tables. Examples include selecting data from tables, joining tables to retrieve related information, deleting records, and filtering data based on specific conditions. Various SQL commands such as SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, and JOIN are used to perform these operations.
Relational Algebra:

*This section contains files demonstrating relational algebra operations such as projection, selection, join, and union. These files illustrate fundamental concepts in relational database theory.
Logical Queries:

*Logical query files contain examples of complex SQL queries involving multiple tables, subqueries, and conditional logic. These queries showcase advanced querying techniques used to extract specific information from a database.
DDL (Data Definition Language):

*DDL files include statements for defining database schema elements such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints. These files are used to create, modify, and manage the structure of a database.
